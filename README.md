#Titanic Classification:
Overview:
This project involves building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

Dataset:
Source: Use the famous Titanic dataset available on platforms like Kaggle, containing information about passengers' attributes and survival status.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify patterns.
Model Development:
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset and handle missing values.
Model Selection: Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) based on the nature of the problem.
Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training set and fine-tune parameters.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
Deployment:
Usage: Provide instructions on how to use the trained model to predict survival probabilities for new passenger data.
Dependencies: List the necessary libraries and versions required to run the code.
Results:
Include visualizations or tables summarizing the model's performance and insights gained from feature importance analysis.

Future Improvements:
Discuss potential avenues for improvement, such as trying different algorithms, incorporating additional features, or optimizing model parameters.

#Cat and Dog Image Classifier:
Overview:
